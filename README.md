 A unique chess game on Matic Blockchain
TITLE:  MYSTERIOUS CHESS

Numbers of players: multiplayer


A Brief Description of game: Harry Potter Chess Game/Wizards Chess
Chess pieces are characters created by our Narrative Director Rishina Tyagi.
Players play Chess but the chess pieces are different creatures/monsters/wizards that have different abilities. The wizard outside the Chessboard can use a certain amount of spells during the match but once these spells are used, they cannot be used again. However, the powerful chess pieces have abilities that can be used after a certain amount of moves by both players. 
Matches have mana caps for the spells. Spells have different manas (2,3,4,7) and if the mana cap is 15, you can use spells with 7 and 8 mana cap.
32 chess pieces should be playable which means 16 chess pieces each side plus 2-4 additional characters.
Chessboard will be decorated with elements of light and dark, with designs influenced by the lore. 
The game plays as normal chess but the chess pieces are different and the chess pieces have different abilities that can flip the tide of the game. 
One side makes moves against the other side until a path is made straight to the king piece, meaning the other side has lost - checkmate. 
Few special spells that can be used once in the entire game like transporting the king piece, swapping 2 pieces, replenishing spirit powers, etc. 
 

Layout
Each square represents a faction that has a specific skill - fire, earth, air, water, poison, etc. Also, there are spirit beasts that were scattered throughout the land that have been captured and tamed by the factions to make them pawns in the game. 
Due to some conflict (war, death, disease), these factions divided themselves into 2 sides - Dark and Light - because of their differing opinions. 
Ancient setup

Original Rishu Story
There was a really strong and powerful master who came from an impoverished background and trained to master different powers of the factions. But he was not interested in ruling any faction and instead set up an academy where he and his friends/disciples taught the different powers and medicine. 
No nobles or children of leaders were allowed to attend the academy as before this old man, it was believed only they could cultivate the powers and common people were lacking in that ability. 
This was not to discriminate and simply because the old man believed that the devotion to this type of learning required a lot of focus that as rulers those people could not spare without neglecting the people they ruled over. The old man also believed that by training the different powers one reached closer to enlightenment.
Years passed and no one could stand up against the academy. The old master also had a daughter who was his disciple. His daughter was not his main disciple though as he had found an abandoned baby before her birth and had decided to raise it at his academy and teach him. 
The daughter and main disciple grew up together and were best friends and fell in love. Meanwhile, due to fear of this academy becoming a bigger power in the land but being unable to go against the old master, many ruling families came together to decide what to do. 
The first problem was that the cultivating method in this academy was important to acquire because they used a different and more powerful method/spells. (The academy taught people to use their own spirit more and not get the aid of outside stuff to make magic - spirit use required different spells. Also, they could replenish the spirit they had lost through specific potions that the old man had invented and refined by using them on himself. By experimenting on himself, the old master shortened his life span otherwise with his power he would have lived for much longer.) 
The head of the ruling faction decided that the son of a greedy and power-hungry merchant should be sent as a spy. The son had blood from a ruling family as the merchant had been married to a weak daughter of a ruling family. The head of the ruling faction was the spy’s aunt.
The spy hated his father but had been told that his mother’s death was the fault of the academy (he found out that was false later but by then he had a different reason to go against the people of the academy). The spy was enrolled and he became friends by accident with the daughter and the main disciple. (He also fell in love with the daughter slowly, obviously)
The old man's health deteriorated by the time the kids were old enough to graduate and when he died he told the main disciple to control the entire land under him. The old man’s one mistake had been that his lack of need for power cost him his wife as she had been perceived as his only weakness then. She was humiliated and killed by an arrogant faction as a warning to stop the creation of his school and in retaliation, he wiped out the faction in one go.
He wanted his main disciple to protect his daughter and so he wanted him to use the connections made by the school, which the daughter would inherit and run, and gain control over all the factions.
The old man had also seen through the spy’s intentions but had seen potential in him to be good and so he didn’t warn the disciple and daughter about their friend before dying. What he didn’t realize was that the spy was also very jealous of the disciple because of the daughter and would go against him for only this.
When the old man died, war erupted and both sides prepared. What shocked the school side and all its ally factions was that their supposed second-in-command had ended up leading the other side of the battlefield as the spy chose the dark side. 
And fighting now.
NOTE: Although the leader of the Light side is the main disciple, the secret weapon is the daughter as she had been born after the conduction of an experimental magical ritual between the old master and his wife. It was because they were scared about what to do that the old man’s wife had gone in search for an ancient herb/medicine/something to make her child normal. This is why she had separated from her husband and daughter and wound up dead. The girl has a dormant power that is unlocked at age 18 - and her birthday is very close to when the war starts. Due to that power being locked away in her by her father so that she could learn what it meant to be human before she was bestowed with all that power, she had never been able to do magic. That is why in the disciple and daughter team, the disciple was considered the magical fighter while the daughter had a large knowledge base. People also thought that the disciple had been taken in by the old man because his daughter was useless even though the disciple was adopted before her birth.
